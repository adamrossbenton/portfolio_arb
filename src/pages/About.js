        <h1>Who am I? Am I... Developer?</h1>
        <p>I am <i>a</i> developer, yes. However, I'm also quite a few other things.</p><br />
        <p>I started out with plans for med school, and fortunately gave up on that plan long before I got to the MCAT, which still sounds like a nightmare to me. I ended up studying and minoring in Latin, because all of the other language classes were full and I figured Latin would help me sound smart. I ended up with a Bachelor's in Chemistry, which I still <i>kind of</i> use to this day as a Clinical Research Associate.</p>
        <h3>But why male models? I mean... web design?</h3>
        <p>At some point in my career, I made the mistake of outing myself as one of the more tech-savvy employees in my department, so I was placed in charge of streamlining several processes and developing tools to make all of our lives easier. At a certain point in this process, I realized that this had become my favorite part of the job. Now, a significant portion of my work is automated through macros I wrote for Excel in VBA, and I'm working on throwing together a couple Python scripts to clean up some other miscellaneous tasks. A couple bootcamp courses and some time on the internet later and here I am, designing websites for you.</p>
